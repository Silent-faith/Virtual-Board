# Virtual-Board

Here I have created a virtual board on which we can write using the hand geasutres. For creating this I had used the mediapiepe library of the Google. I had also made a flask app for using it by which you can run it as a web app on your PC. By using that it can also run on your phine also. 

### Pre-requisites

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Instructions
